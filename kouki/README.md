### Simple Acquaintances

## Problem

In this example, we attempt to predict acquaintance links between different people.
This problem is made to be very small and is great for when you want to dig into the detail of what PSL is doing,
since it would not be infeasible to write out all the grounds/potentials.

## Dataset

The dataset is synthetic and small.
It contains information on where people have lived, what activities they like/dislike, and some already observed acquaintance links.
